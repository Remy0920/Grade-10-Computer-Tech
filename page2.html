    <h1>Reducing the Environmental Impacts of Computers</h1>
    <h2>Minimizing the Impact of Computer Production</h2>
    <p>Computer production can have many harmful effects on the environment, with a large impact being from the increasing amounts of water and other raw materials extracted and used in computer construction.  Due to this, it would be very benificial if companies responsible for computer manufacturing to ensure that all raw materials are sourced/harvested in an environmentally responsible way, and prioritizing the use of recycled products or responsibly mined materials for the production of new computers. Using resources more efficiently during the manufacturing process can help reduce environmental impact. This includes better design techniques to reduce material waste and using energy-efficient manufacturing processes. Computers are usually build with petroleum-based plastics, which. But a possible alternative to this could be the use of bioplastics made from renewable resources such as plant cellulose, since products made from these materials are often biodegradable. </p>

    <h2>Minimizing the Impact of Computer Usage</h2>
    <p>One of the main environmental issues from computer usage is energy production and comsumption, since it often leads to pollution and CO2 emissions. A simple way to combat this issue would be to simply design and begin utilizing more enrgy efficient computer hardwares, softwares and data centres, with cloud-based storage systems often being considered more environmentally friendly as phyisical storage systems. A potential way to begin could be to create and utilize intelligent energy management systems to reduce energy waste. Besides reducing energy waste, these systems could provide valuable insights into energy consumption patterns, and provide ways to better conserve energy. Virtualization is a key enabler of cloud computing systems that also contributes to energy efficiency, allowing servers to run multiple operating systems or applications simultaneously, optimizing the use of hardware. Overall, transitioning to loud-computing systems would theoretically reduce envirnomental impacts, however it would heavily depend on whether the enrgy was supllied though natural sources such as solar, hydro, or wind power.

    <h2>Minimizing the Impact of Computer Disposal</h2>
    <p>Once a computer is unfunctional or it no longer needed by the comsumer, it is usually thrown away, and considering how many people have access to computers today, this can lead to significant amounts of e-waste. A simple way to try and reduce the effects of this simply be for people to try and donate any computers or devices no longer useful to them, to people who the devices would be more useful to, rather than simply throwing them away. If possible, try to choose computers that are designed to be easy to disassemble for recycling, since this can contribute significantly to reducing e-waste. When disposing of computers or other technology, it would be very benificial to try to extract any materials like metal, plastic or glass. These materials can then be recycled and reused to manufacture new products, Reducing the need to extract new materials from the earth for manufacturing.</p>
