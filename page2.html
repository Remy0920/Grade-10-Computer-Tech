    <h1>Reducing the Environmental Impacts of Computers</h1>
    <h2>Minimizing the Impact of Computer Production</h2>
    <p>Source/harvest materials in an environmentally responsible way, try to prioritize using recycled products or responsibly mined materials for the production of new computers.</p>

    <h2>Minimizing the Impact of Computer Usage</h2>
    <p>One of the main environmental issues from computer usage is energy production and comsumption, since it often leads to pollution and CO2 emissions. A simple way to combat this issue would be to simply design and begin utilizing more enrgy efficient computer hardwares, softwares and data centres, with cloud-based storage systems often being considered more environmentally friendly as phyisical storage systems. A potential way to begin could be to create and utilize intelligent energy management systems to reduce energy waste. Besides reducing energy waste, these systems could provide valuable insights into energy consumption patterns, and provide ways to better conserve energy. Virtualization is a key enabler of cloud computing systems that also contributes to energy efficiency, allowing servers to run multiple operating systems or applications simultaneously, optimizing the use of hardware. Overall, transitioning to loud-computing systems would theoretically reduce envirnomental impacts, however it would heavily depend on whether the enrgy was supllied though natural sources such as solar, hydro, or wind power.
