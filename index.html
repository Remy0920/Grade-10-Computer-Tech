    <h1>Harmful Environmental Impacts of Computers</h1>
    <h2>Impacts of Computer production</h2>
    <p> Computers first began being mass-produced in 1977, and today computers are being used more and more, and the demand for them is continuously rising. Manufacturing computers requires large amounts of water and valuable materials which along with rising demands, can quickly deplete many natural resources important to the environment. Many computer parts are made from raw materials that are extracted from the Earth itself. Due to the high amounts of computer production, this can potentially damage variuos local ecosystems, contribute to deforestation, losses in biodiversity, and overall environmental degradation.
</p>

    <p> Raw materials used in computers: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gold</li>
        <li>Silver</li>
        <li>Iron</li>
        <li>Lead</li>
        <li>Aluminum</li>
        <li>Copper</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Harmful pollutants can be released into the environment during the computer production process, especially during the transformation and production of raw materials into computer components, which is often energy-intensive and resulting in further CO2 emissions.</p>
