    <h1>Harmful Environmental Impacts of Computers</h1>
    <h2>Impacts of Computer Production</h2>
    <p> Computers first began being mass-produced in 1977, and today computers are being used more and more, and the demand for them is continuously rising. Manufacturing computers requires large amounts of water and valuable materials which along with rising demands, can quickly deplete many natural resources important to the environment. Many computer parts are made from raw materials that are extracted from the Earth itself. Due to the high amounts of computer production, this can potentially damage variuos local ecosystems, contribute to deforestation, losses in biodiversity, and overall environmental degradation.
</p>

    <p> Raw materials used in computers: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gold</li>
        <li>Silver</li>
        <li>Iron</li>
        <li>Lead</li>
        <li>Aluminum</li>
        <li>Copper</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Harmful pollutants can be released into the environment during the computer production process, especially during the transformation and production of raw materials into computer components, which is often energy-intensive and resulting in further CO2 emissions.</p>
    
    <h2>Impacts of Computer Usage</h2>
    <p>Computer usage and Internet data centres in particular contribute to a substancial amount of the global energy usage. The annual electricity report from the International Energy Agency said global data centers consumed <b>460TWh</b> in 2022 (2% of the global energy usage), and could possibly rise to between <b>650TWh</b> to <b>1050TWh</b> by 2026. Using computers involves significant amounts of energy consumption, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse emissions play a major role in global warming and climate change. Energy production and consumption also connects to major environmental issues such as air/water/thermal pollution. It is also concerning that a majority of the energy used during the production and use of computers come from non-renewable energy soucres such as fossil fuels.</p>

    <h2>Impacts of Computer Disposal</h2>
    <p>As computers and all technology continues to evolve and improve, older hardwares will continue to be discarded, leading to the production of e-waste. In 2019, the world generated a striking 53.6 million metric tonnes of e-waste, according to the Global E-waste Monitor, with a significant proportion of this e-waste coming from computers and related devices. The majority of e-waste often ends up in landfills, which allows hazardous substances to pollute into the soil and water leading to environmental damages. E-waste is sometimes dumped into developing countries where it may be handled improperly, leading to harmful effects on the environment such as the exposure to lead/mercury contained in the devices. Computers contains many valuable and limited materials including gold, palladuim, silver, and other rare earth elements. If computers are disposed of without recycling them, these valuable materials that could have been recycled and reused, will instead be wasted. </p>
